# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

This project provides an introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning using Python and Scikit-Learn. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that detects Parkinson's disease from voice patterns, which could assist in early diagnosis and treatment.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Build a machine learning model to accurately detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease from voice recordings.
- **Techniques**: Implement decision trees and support vector machines (SVM).
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-Learn.
- **Optimization**: Use grid search for parameter tuning and improve model performance.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess voice data.
2. **Model Training**: Implement decision trees and SVM to classify the presence of Parkinson's disease.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform a grid search to optimize model parameters.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the decision tree to interpret feature importance.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning.
- Install required libraries.
